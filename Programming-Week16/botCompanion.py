DudeAI 2.0 blends our original NLP chatbot with wellness features in a relaxed style:
1. Keeps all original family/pet/teacher recognition
2. Adds stress-relief tools (breathing, journaling)
3. Tracks mood trends without being pushy
4. Offers creative escapes (storytelling)
5. Maintains that easy-going "dude" personality
